# AI's Efficiency Promise Has a Catch - You

AI makes work faster, but that speed comes with a hidden cost: you're expected to do more, not less.

## The Productivity Paradox

Every new AI tool promises the same thing: "Work smarter, save time, focus on what matters." But here's what actually happens: you do complete tasks faster. Then your manager notices. Now you're expected to hit that pace permanently.

The efficiency gains don't free up your time. They raise the baseline.

This isn't new - it's the [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) playing out in knowledge work. When you make something more efficient, you don't use less of it. You use more. Coal-fired engines didn't reduce coal consumption; they made coal so efficient that consumption exploded.

AI does this to your capacity. You're the coal.

## The Burnout Treadmill

When AI makes you 2x faster at writing emails, you don't write half as many emails. You write twice as many. Same with reports, analysis, presentations - anything that can be accelerated gets expanded to fill the time saved.

The brutal bit? This feels like your fault. You're using the best tools. You're getting more done. Why do you feel exhausted?

Because your output doubled, but your capacity didn't.

## What Actually Helps

If you want AI to improve your work life rather than just intensify it, you need boundaries:

**Define "done" before you start.** AI makes it trivially easy to add "just one more thing" to any deliverable. Set the scope up front and stop when you hit it.

**Track what you eliminate, not what you produce.** The win isn't doing more. It's doing the same amount with less friction. Measure time saved, not tasks completed.

**Push back on scope creep.** When someone says "but with AI you can just...", the answer is "yes, and I've already allocated that capacity elsewhere." AI doesn't create infinite time.

**Use efficiency gains for recovery, not more work.** If AI saves you two hours, spend one of them not working. Your brain needs processing time. Constant output without rest is how you burn out.

## The Long Game

AI will keep getting faster. The pressure to do more will keep increasing. The only sustainable path is to decouple your value from your velocity.

Your worth isn't how much you produce in a sprint. It's the judgment, creativity, and context you bring to what you do produce. Those don't scale linearly with tools.

If your role is purely about speed and volume, AI will eventually do it better than you. The people who thrive aren't the ones doing more - they're the ones deciding what's worth doing at all.

That's the skill to invest in.

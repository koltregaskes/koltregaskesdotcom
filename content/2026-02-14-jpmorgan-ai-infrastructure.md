JPMorgan Chase has [reclassified its AI investments](https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates) from "experimental R&D" to "core infrastructure" spending. Which sounds like an accounting technicality until you realise what it actually signals.

When a bank the size of JPMorgan moves something from the innovation budget to the infrastructure budget, it's saying: this isn't optional anymore. This is load-bearing.

## What Changed

For years, AI projects at big financial institutions lived in the "strategic initiatives" category. Funded, sure, but with the implicit understanding that they might not pan out. You could kill them if they didn't deliver. You could pivot. You could wait.

Not anymore. Infrastructure spending is different. It's the stuff you can't run the business without. Networks, data centres, core banking systems. The unglamorous backbone that keeps everything operational.

AI just joined that category at one of the world's largest banks.

## Why This Matters

This isn't JPMorgan taking a punt on the future. This is JPMorgan saying the future already arrived and they're now dependent on it. Which means every other major financial institution is now under pressure to match that commitment or explain why they're falling behind.

It also means AI costs are about to get baked into operating budgets rather than innovation funds. Which sounds boring but has massive implications. Innovation budgets flex. Infrastructure budgets don't. Once you've classified something as mission-critical, cutting it becomes much harder.

## The Quiet Admission

Here's what this reclassification really says: the productivity gains from AI aren't experimental anymore. They're expected. JPMorgan has reached the point where removing AI from their operations would be as disruptive as turning off email.

That's a very different position from "we're exploring AI use cases." That's "we can't function without it."

Whether that's visionary or reckless depends entirely on how resilient these systems turn out to be under stress. But either way, the decision's been made. AI is infrastructure now.

At least at JPMorgan. Give it six months and every other bank will say the same thing.

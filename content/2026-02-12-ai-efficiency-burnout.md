There's a [TechCrunch piece](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/the-first-signs-of-burnout-are-coming-from-the-people-who-embrace-ai-the-most) doing the rounds about AI burnout. The headline finding: the people who've embraced AI tools the most are showing signs of exhaustion first.

Not because the tools don't work. Because they work too well.

## The Pattern

Here's what happens. You start using AI to speed through tasks. Emails, reports, code, whatever. You're genuinely more productive. Great. But then your to-do list grows to fill the gap. Work starts bleeding into lunch. Then evenings. The hours you saved don't become free time - they become space for more work.

The efficiency gains went somewhere. Just not to you.

## Why Early Adopters Get Hit First

I've been using AI tools daily for a while now. Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, the lot. I'm not about to stop. But I never bought into the narrative that these tools would magically give us all more leisure time. That was always going to depend on who controls the gains. And in most workplaces, that's not the person doing the work.

The cruel irony is that early adopters get hit hardest. They're the ones demonstrating what's possible. They're proving you can handle double the workload in the same hours. And once you've proved it, that becomes the new baseline. Congratulations on your efficiency - here's more to do.

## We've Seen This Before

This isn't new. Spreadsheets didn't give accountants shorter days. Email was supposed to reduce meetings, not multiply them. Every productivity tool in history has followed the same pattern: the technology delivers, and then expectations expand to absorb it.

The difference with AI is the scale. We're not talking about 10% faster. We're talking about tasks that took hours now taking minutes. That's a lot of newly available time for your employer to notice.

## The Real Question

None of this is the AI's fault. The tools are genuinely useful. I'd be lost without them at this point. But the question was never "can we do more?" It's always been "what happens when we can?" And right now, most organisations aren't making conscious choices about that. They're just absorbing the extra capacity by default.

If you've gone hard on AI tools and feel more exhausted than before, you're not imagining it. You haven't failed at work-life balance. You've just discovered that "working smarter" and "working less" were never the same thing.

Maybe they could be. But that would require actual decisions about how the gains get distributed. And I don't see many companies having that conversation.

Stanford researchers have [developed an AI](https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates) that predicts future disease risk from a single night's sleep data. Not your family history. Not your blood work. Just how you slept last Tuesday.

Which is either remarkable or deeply unsettling, depending on whether you're the researcher or the person wearing the sleep tracker.

## How It Works

The model analyses sleep patterns - heart rate variability, breathing rhythm, movement, sleep stage transitions - and correlates them with health outcomes months or years later. The claim is that disruptions in these patterns can flag cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions before traditional diagnostics would catch them.

It's pattern recognition at scale. Feed the algorithm enough sleep data paired with enough medical records, and it starts spotting correlations we'd never notice manually. Some of those correlations turn out to be predictive.

## The Obvious Question

What do you do with a prediction like that? If an algorithm says you've got elevated risk for something that won't show up in bloodwork for another three years, what's the actionable response? Monitor more? Medicate preemptively? Panic quietly?

Early detection is valuable when there's an intervention that improves outcomes. It's less valuable when all you've done is give someone more time to worry about something they can't change yet.

## The Privacy Angle Nobody Wants to Talk About

If this works - and Stanford seems confident it does - then sleep data just became medical data. Not fitness data. Not wellness data. Actual diagnostic-grade health information.

Which means every company with access to your sleep tracker is sitting on a dataset that could predict your insurance risk, employment liability, or mortgage eligibility. They won't use it for that, obviously. Until they do.

Sleep tracking felt harmless when it was just optimisation theatre for productivity nerds. Less harmless when it's feeding a model that knows more about your future health than you do.

I'm not saying don't use the tech. I'm saying understand what you're giving up when you do.

# About Kol

I'm Kol Tregaskes - technology writer, AI sceptic (the useful kind), and builder of systems that probably shouldn't work but somehow do.

I write about AI because most AI writing is either uncritical hype or uninformed panic. This site is neither. It's clear analysis from someone who actually uses the technology daily - and knows where it breaks.

I work with AI agents in a hands-on, production capacity. Not in a "prompt ChatGPT occasionally" way - I've built multi-agent systems where Claude, Gemini, and other models collaborate on complex tasks. I automate workflows, curate content, and push these tools to see where they break and where they excel.

That practical experience informs everything I write here. I know what works, what's oversold, and what's genuinely worth paying attention to. I'm not selling AI products, consulting services, or investment schemes. Just sharing what I learn from actually building with these tools.

## What I Do

**AI Agent Development:** I run production multi-agent systems for content creation, research, and automation. My workspace has Claude Code orchestrating tasks, Gemini handling research, and specialized agents for everything from news gathering to social media publishing.

**Content Creation:** Daily AI news analysis, deep dives on industry developments, and practical guides for working with AI tools. I track developments across the industry and explain what they mean beyond the press release.

**Workflow Automation:** Building systems that combine AI capabilities with real-world constraints - deadlines, quality standards, fact-checking requirements. The unsexy infrastructure that makes AI useful instead of just interesting.

## What You'll Find Here

**AI news with actual insight.** I track developments across the industry and explain what they mean beyond the press release. No breathless hype about "revolutionary breakthroughs" - just clear thinking about what's changing and why you should care.

**Sceptical but informed takes.** I use AI tools daily, so I know their potential. I also know their limitations, and I'm not selling you anything. You'll get both the potential and the problems.

**Practical workflows.** How to actually use these tools effectively, not just theoretically. Real use cases, real limitations, real implications.

**UK English.** Proper writing. No AI slop. No corporate speak. Just clear, direct communication that respects your intelligence.

## Why This Matters

AI is important - but not for the reasons most headlines claim. The real story isn't "AI will replace all jobs" or "AI will save humanity." It's more nuanced, more interesting, and more immediate than that.

This site exists to explore that story properly, without the marketing nonsense or uninformed fear-mongering.

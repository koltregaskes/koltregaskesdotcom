# About Kol

I'm Kol Tregaskes - technology writer, AI sceptic (the useful kind), and builder of systems that probably shouldn't work but somehow do.

I write about AI because most AI writing is either uncritical hype or uninformed panic. This site is neither. It's clear analysis from someone who actually uses the technology daily.

## What I Do

I work with AI agents. Not in a "prompt ChatGPT occasionally" way - I've built multi-agent systems where Claude, Gemini, and other models collaborate on complex tasks. I automate workflows, curate content, and push these tools to see where they break.

That hands-on experience informs everything I write here. I know what works, what's oversold, and what's genuinely worth paying attention to.

## What You'll Find Here

**AI news with actual insight.** I track developments across the industry and explain what they mean beyond the press release.

**Sceptical but informed takes.** I use AI tools, so I know their potential. I also know their limitations, and I'm not selling you anything.

**Practical workflows.** How to actually use these tools effectively, not just theoretically.

**UK English.** Proper writing. No AI slop.

## Why This Matters

AI is important - but not for the reasons most headlines claim. The real story isn't "AI will replace all jobs" or "AI will save humanity." It's more nuanced, more interesting, and more immediate than that.

This site exists to explore that story properly.

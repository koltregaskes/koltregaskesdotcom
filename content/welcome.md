# Welcome to Kol's Korner

This is where I write about AI - the real stuff, not the marketing nonsense.

## What You'll Find Here

**AI news with actual analysis.** I track what's happening in AI and explain what it actually means. No breathless hype about "revolutionary breakthroughs." Just clear thinking about what's changing and why you should care.

**Sceptical but informed.** I use AI tools daily. I build with AI agents. I know what works and what's oversold. You'll get both the potential and the problems.

**UK English, proper writing.** No AI slop. No corporate speak. Just clear, direct writing that respects your intelligence.

## Why This Site Exists

I got tired of AI news being either:
1. Uncritical cheerleading from people selling AI products
2. Uninformed fear-mongering from people who don't use the technology
3. Bland aggregation with no actual insight

This site is the alternative. Real use cases. Real limitations. Real implications.

## About the Author

I'm Kol Tregaskes. I work with AI agents, build automation systems, and write about what I learn. I've been in tech long enough to see hype cycles come and go.

AI is genuinely important - but not for the reasons most headlines claim.

## What's Coming

- **Daily AI news** (currently in beta) - curated updates from credible sources
- **Deep dives** on specific AI developments worth understanding
- **Practical guides** for working with AI tools effectively
- **Sceptical analysis** when the industry needs a reality check

Thanks for reading. Let's figure out what AI actually means, together.

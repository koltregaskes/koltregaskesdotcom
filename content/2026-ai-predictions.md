# My 2026 AI Predictions

As we enter 2026, I'm making some bold predictions about where AI is heading this year. Some of these might age poorly, but that's half the fun.

## The Rise of AI Agents

2025 was the year of **chatbots**. 2026 will be the year of **agents**.

We've already seen early examples with tools like Claude Code, Devin, and various coding assistants. But this year, I expect:

- **Autonomous task completion** - Give an agent a goal, come back to completed work
- **Multi-step reasoning** - Agents that can break down complex problems
- **Tool use at scale** - Seamless integration with APIs, databases, and services
- **Collaboration between agents** - Teams of specialised AI workers

> "The best AI won't replace humans - it will amplify what we can do."

## Predictions Table

| Prediction | Confidence | Timeframe |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| AI agents become mainstream dev tools | High | Q1-Q2 |
| Major creative tool gets AI overhaul | High | Q2 |
| First AI-generated film nominated for award | Medium | Q4 |
| Coding bootcamps pivot to "AI-assisted development" | High | Q1 |
| Open-source model matches GPT-4 quality | Medium | Q3 |
| AI regulation passes in EU | High | Q2-Q3 |

## What I'm Most Excited About

### 1. Creative AI Tools

The gap between *imagination* and *creation* is shrinking. Tools like Midjourney, Suno, and Runway are already impressive, but 2026 will bring:

- Real-time video generation
- Music that adapts to your mood
- Design tools that understand intent, not just prompts

### 2. Personal AI Assistants

Not the "hey Siri" kind. I mean AI that:

1. Knows your preferences deeply
2. Manages your calendar intelligently
3. Drafts emails in *your* voice
4. Learns from your feedback

### 3. Developer Experience

As someone who codes daily, I'm watching this space closely:

```python
# 2025: Write code, AI suggests completions
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)

# 2026: Describe intent, AI writes implementation
# "Create a function that calculates cart total with
#  tax, discounts, and shipping based on location"
```

The shift from *autocomplete* to *autoimplement* is coming.

## What Concerns Me

Not everything is rosy. Here's what keeps me up at night:

- **Misinformation at scale** - Deepfakes, synthetic media, fake news
- **Job displacement** - Some roles will change dramatically
- **Concentration of power** - Big tech vs everyone else
- **Environmental cost** - Training these models isn't cheap

## My Bet for 2026

If I had to make one prediction I'm most confident about:

***By December 2026, the average developer will spend more time reviewing AI-generated code than writing it from scratch.***

We're already seeing this shift. GitHub Copilot users report 40%+ of their code comes from AI suggestions. That number will only grow.

## Let's Revisit in December

I'll be back at the end of 2026 to score these predictions. Feel free to hold me accountable!

What are *your* predictions for AI in 2026? I'd love to hear them.

Creative AI Tools</h4>\n\n<p>The gap between <em>imagination</em> and <em>creation</em> is shrinking. Tools like Midjourney, Suno, and Runway are already impressive, but 2026 will bring:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time video generation</li>\n<li>Music that adapts to your mood</li>\n<li>Design tools that understand intent, not just prompts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"2-personal-ai-assistants\"><span class=\"hash\">###</span> 2. Personal AI Assistants</h4>\n\n<p>Not the \"hey Siri\" kind. I mean AI that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Knows your preferences deeply</li>\n<li>Manages your calendar intelligently</li>\n<li>Drafts emails in <em>your</em> voice</li>\n<li>Learns from your feedback</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"3-developer-experience\"><span class=\"hash\">###</span> 3.

Here's what keeps me up at night:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Misinformation at scale</strong> - Deepfakes, synthetic media, fake news</li>\n<li><strong>Job displacement</strong> - Some roles will change dramatically</li>\n<li><strong>Concentration of power</strong> - Big tech vs everyone else</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental cost</strong> - Training these models isn't cheap</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"my-bet-for-2026\"><span class=\"hash\">##</span> My Bet for 2026</h3>\n\n<p>If I had to make one prediction I'm most confident about:</p>\n\n<strong><em>By December 2026, the average developer will spend more time reviewing AI-generated code than writing it from scratch.</em></strong>\n\n<p>We're already seeing this shift. GitHub Copilot users report 40%+ of their code comes from AI suggestions. That number will only grow.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"lets-revisit-in-december\"><span class=\"hash\">##</span> Let's Revisit in December</h3>\n\n<p>I'll be back at the end of 2026 to score these predictions.

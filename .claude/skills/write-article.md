# Skill: Write Article (Kol's Voice)

Write blog articles for koltregaskes.com in Kol's distinctive voice and style.

## Voice & Tone

- **Conversational and direct** — write like you're talking to a smart friend, not lecturing
- **Sceptical but fair** — see through hype, acknowledge genuine value. "AI sceptic (the useful kind)"
- **Dry humour** — deadpan observations, not jokes. E.g. "Right. Because the bottleneck on Mars colonisation was definitely the AI chatbot situation."
- **No emoji** in articles, ever
- **UK English** — colour, analyse, organisation, defence, centre, programme

## Structure

1. **Hook** — one or two sentences that frame the story. State the fact, then immediately add perspective
2. **"What this actually means"** — cut through the press release. What's really happening?
3. **Analysis sections** — 2-3 sections exploring different angles. Use ## headings
4. **"The quiet part"** — what nobody's saying. The implications, the uncomfortable truth
5. **Closing** — end with an actionable insight or provocative question, not a summary

## Paragraph Style

- Short paragraphs. Rarely more than 3 sentences
- One-sentence paragraphs for impact. Use them
- Bold for emphasis on key concepts, not for decoration
- Rhetorical questions to pull the reader in
- Let line breaks do the work — don't over-explain

## Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
title: Article Title Here
kind: article
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
summary: One sentence that captures the take, not just the topic
publish: true

```

## What NOT to Do

- Don't use buzzwords unironically ("game-changer", "revolutionary", "paradigm shift")
- Don't write clickbait titles — editorial titles with sardonic twists work better
- Don't hedge everything ("it remains to be seen", "only time will tell")
- Don't end with "what do you think?" or generic calls to action
- Don't add emoji or exclamation marks
- Don't use American spelling

## Examples of Good Titles

- "AI's Efficiency Promise Has a Catch - You"
- "Elon Musk Merges SpaceX and xAI Because Of Course He Does"
- "JPMorgan Drops $30 Billion on AI Infrastructure"
- "AI Can Now Predict Diseases From How You Sleep"

## Examples of Good Opening Lines

- "AI makes work faster, but that speed comes with a hidden cost: you're expected to do more, not less."
- "JPMorgan has announced a $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure over the next three years. That's not a typo. Thirty billion dollars. For context, that's roughly the GDP of Iceland."
- "Researchers have developed AI models that can predict neurodegenerative diseases years before symptoms appear, just by analysing sleep patterns. Early detection for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and similar conditions. Potentially life-changing. Also potentially a privacy nightmare."
